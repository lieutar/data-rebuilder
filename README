Data-Rebuilder

Like Data::Dumper. But it rebuilds more.

 * Tied variable.
 * Cycled closure.
 * Any objects , and loading its module files.

In addition, this module provides easy way to parameterize arbitrary node
of the composite.

e.g.

  use Data::Rebuilder;
  my $target = [
                 [
                   [],
                   [],
                 ],
               ];
  my $b = Data::Rebuilder->new();
  $b->parameterize( foo => \$target->[0]->[1] );
  my $src = $b->rebuilder( $target );
  my $rebuilder = eval $src;
  my $obj = $rebuilder->( foo => [ 0 ... 9 ] );
  
  use Data::Dumper;
  print Dumper $obj;

This code prints:

  $VAR1 = [
            [
              [],
              [
                0,
                1,
                2,
                3,
                4,
                5,
                6,
                7,
                8,
                9,
              ]
            ]
          ];
